We conducted an exploratory, longitudinal study of functional language networks underlying recovery of language in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute severe TBI.  We measured language-evoked functional MRI (fMRI) responses in right and left superior temporal gyrus [STGR, STGL], and right and left inferior frontal gyrus [IFGR, IFGL]).  Additionally, given the complex neuroanatomy of language processing in the human brain, with known contributions from various cortical regions (Price, 2012), we conducted a whole-brain analysis to identify regions outside of the canonical frontotemporal language network related to recovery of language.  Finally, to explore whether language recovery is associated with reorganization versus reemergence of language networks, we compared fMRI responses in patients to those in healthy control subjects.
